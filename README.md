## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please check the following:

  - **Firebase Connection**: Make sure `google-services.json` is correctly placed and that your Firebase project is properly configured.
  - **Permissions**: Ensure all required Android permissions (e.g., storage, camera) have been granted.
  - **Steganography**: For best results, use PNG images and avoid highly compressed images, as they may cause data loss.

For more detailed guides, check the `Documentation` folder.
